 Java Program to transpose a Matrix

The transpose of a matrix is a new matrix whose rows are the columns of the original. 
This means when you transpose a matrix the columns of the new matrix become the rows of the original matrix and vice-versa. In short, to transpose a matrix, 
just swap the rows and columns of the matrix.
