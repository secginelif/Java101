-----valueMaxMin-----
finding the largest and the smallest numbers by entered numbers
basically max and min value of numbers

-----findingPerfectNumber-----
finding perfect number
"Perfect numbers” are equal to the sum of their “proper” divisors (positive integers that divide a number evenly, not counting itself).
----finding min and max numbers----
finding min and max sie numbers by entered of numbers with methods in addition using for and if-else methods

----finding perfect numbers----
In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3 (excluding itself), and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number.
in this project using loops and methods.

----invertedTriangle----
using space and stars by created inverted triangle with for methods


----findingPrimeNumbers----
finding prime numbers between 1 and 100 with 
A PRIME NUMBER  is any number that is divisible by 1 and itself only. Certain examples of prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 etc. However, 1 is neither a prime nor composite number.
1- A prime number is a number which has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
2- finding the given number is prime or not using the static method primeCal(int num). For loop iterates from i=0 to i=given number, if the remainder of number/i =0 then increases the count by 1. After all the iterations, if count=2, then that number is a prime number.

----fibonacciNumbersLoop----
In fibonacci series, next number is the sum of previous two numbers for example 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 etc. The first two numbers of fibonacci series are 0 and 1.


----recursivePower----
A recursive function is a function that calls itself multiple times until a particular condition is satisfied.

----createMethodbyPattern----
Creational Design Patterns are concerned with the way in which objects are created.
Creational Design Patterns address this issue by decoupling the client entirely from the actual initialization process.


----bLetterStars----
pattern of alphabets B using * and to create a user-defined sized alphabet's pattern. Number of lines for the alphabet's pattern

----sortsTheElements----
Program that takes the size of the array and the elements of the array from the user and sorts the elements in the array from smallest to largest


----matrixTranspose----
What is the transpose of a matrix?
The transpose of a matrix is found by interchanging its rows into columns or columns into rows.
Converting rows of a matrix into columns and columns of a matrix into row is called transpose of a matrix.
